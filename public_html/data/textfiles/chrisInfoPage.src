text:TXT001	<center>This page is devoted to personal information about me.</center><br /><br />I have been working for quite a few years now on Cruise ships as a bass player. I started my professional career in 1976 in a touring band called “Snubbarna” and later went on to “Midnights Orchestra” and through a few others to “Norrskens Orchester” where I stayed until 1985. At that point I had been on the road for 10 years, and I was looking to find something else to do.<br /><br />I went back to school again and studied “Telecom & Electronics” in secondary school. After that I went to university “Chalmers University of Technology” where I studied “Engineering Physics”. In 1993 I got a job as “Chief Accountant” for the group “PCMAN Norden AB”. I stayd there until I finally moved out of my native Sweden to London, England. I was now determined to get back in to music again, since I am not an office person, and I have for most part of my life been touring.<br /><br />Through the help of some friends I got in touch with an American Blues guitarist “Jonathan Kalb” with whom I worked for a few months, not that it generated a lot of money but anyhow. I had a lot of help from my friends and family over this time. It was a very difficult time and through a couple of years there didn’t seem to be anything that would work. I was involved in quite a few projects. Everything from Oil and Financial Trading to Producing Musicals with my good friend “Phil Ryan”. Phil has been a great friend and has given me a lot of help and moral support through the years, as has my family.<br /><br />I love being at sea. I have always loved water and in my younger days I was trying to get work onboard ships. But, unfortunately this was in the mid 70’s and the Swedish Wharfs and shipping industry had already started to disappear. Then while working holiday camps in the UK I met a lot of guys who had been on cruise ships. Now I thought I can do the two things I like the most, play music and being at sea. So, here I am. Pretty happy with life. The only downside apart from always being away from my daughter “Anna” is the conditions onboard, they usually leaves a lot to be desired. Shared cabins so small that you hardly can get your suitcase opened inside. No privacy at all. And it seems to be getting worse. Older ships usually have larger cabins and better, even though in some places run down, facilities for the crew. Newer ships are mostly steel bunk beds and horribly small. Strange since the ships themselves has grown much bigger, and yet they provide smaller cabins for crew. Not to mention Philippinos and Indonesians and other crew from poorer countries who usually gets stashed 4 in a cabin intended for 2 crew, what ever happened to taking care of your employees and their welfare? Not words that mean a whole lot in todays cruise industry.<br /><br />Since I know that I can't go on living and working like this for the rest of my life, unless there is a drastic change in conditions, both regarding cabins and overall care about employees. My plan for the future is to find a nice home in Southeast Asia. For me it's the most beautiful place on earth, and the people there are truly wonderful, with a very few exceptions. There I will hopefully be able to run my own webdesign, networking, and programming company. That's why I already has started working as a freelance programmer and webdesigner.

Then as I have promised so many of my musician friends, I will get the database for "Musicians", "Artists", and "Cruise Lines" <a href="http://midb.maverick-web.com">MIDB</a> up and running too. In the mean time I just opened a <a href="http://www.maverick-web.com/friends">Bulletin board</a> that is now up and running.
