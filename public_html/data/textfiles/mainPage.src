text:TXT001	This site is about me. So there will be a lot of ME, I, and MINE, but I'm usually not too bad with that. I'm always on the road or afloat (hopefully), I'm quite difficult to get a hold of, as most of my friends and family has experienced over the years. For  those of you who don't know me let me introduce myself. Thanks, (like I said it's my site) I'm working onboard cruise ships as a musician. To be  more precise I'm a bass player. I started working in the music industry as touring musician in 1976 with Snubbarnas Orkester in my native Sweden. Through the years I've worked with more bands and musicians then I can remember. For those of you that I  lost contact with drop me a line on my email address, chris@data4mat.com. I recently moved to Manila, Philippines so if any of you happen to drop by there then drop me a line and if I am home I hope that we can meet up.<br /><hr/><u>Contact Info:</u><br />email:  chris@data4mat.com<br />Telephone: +63 2 800 0050</center>
